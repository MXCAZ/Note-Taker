# Express.js Note-Taker

## Description

For this challenge, It is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. The app uses Express.js and will save and retrieve user generated note data form a JSON file.

The application front end has already created. I got to create the backend and connect the two of them and deploy the finished application to Heroku.
